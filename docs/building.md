# Building

**Fork scope:** build for Retroid Pocket 6, Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 / SM8550, using `SOC=sm8550`. Hardware acceptance uses the 12 GB RAM model with SteamOS on microSD. Other SoC build paths below are inherited upstream reference material. See [RP6-SCOPE.md](RP6-SCOPE.md).

I build everything in an arm64 Linux VM (Colima on a Mac).

- Kernels: `external-and-mods/kernel-sm8650/build.sh` and `external-and-mods/kernel-sm8550/build.sh` (shared script in `kernel-common/`, chip specific bits in each `soc.env`)
- gamescope: `scripts/build-gamescope-in-rootfs.sh`, source in `external-and-mods/gamescope/`
- the image: `make-steamos-sm8650.sh` (`SOC=sm8550` for the 8 Gen 2 one), or `./make-steamos-sm8750.sh` for the Snapdragon 8 Elite (Odin 3); `./make-steamos-sm8350.sh` turns the rootfs from `make-steamos-sm8650.sh` (or a release image) into the REDMAGIC 6 fastboot kit (kernel: `external-and-mods/kernel-sm8350/build.sh`, see [redmagic6.md](redmagic6.md))

Valve's files and the Steam client aren't in this repo, the build downloads them. How the pieces fit together is in [HOW-IT-WORKS.md](HOW-IT-WORKS.md).
