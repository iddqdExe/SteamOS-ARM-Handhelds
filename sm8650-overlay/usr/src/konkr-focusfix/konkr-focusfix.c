/*
 * konkr-focusfix — give games their controls back after the Steam overlay.
 *
 * Opening Quick Access / the Steam menu moves X focus to Steam's window;
 * closing it moves focus back to the game, but Proton's winex11 never
 * re-activates the game (no WM_TAKE_FOCUS), so games that ignore input while
 * inactive stay dead until a click (touchscreen) activates them.
 * This watches the X focus on gamescope's Xwayland and, whenever it returns
 * to the window gamescope has focused (a game, not Steam), repeats what a
 * window manager would do for a WM_TAKE_FOCUS client: send it WM_TAKE_FOCUS.
 * Games in exclusive fullscreen also minimize themselves (WM_STATE Iconic)
 * when the overlay takes focus and never come back: the screen stays black or
 * shows a tiny frozen frame (GTA IV). Remember a game that went Iconic and,
 * once focus is back on it, put WM_STATE through Iconic -> Normal: Wine only
 * restores on that change, and by the time Quick Access closes WM_STATE can
 * already read Normal again with the game still minimized inside Wine.
 *
 * UP-01 adaptation of hashtagbasit/4a12b4, 2026-10-02: recheck focus
 * after the Wine restore delay; never raise a game over a reopened QAM.
 *
